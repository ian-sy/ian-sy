### Hi there, I'm Ian! 👋

- 🎓 I'm a third-year Computing student at Imperial College London.
- 💡 Some of my current interests are artificial intelligence, web development and UI/UX, system design, and game development.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal website (stay tuned!) and a personal tool for simplifying CV writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Figma, Next.js and Scala, as well as refreshing and learning more about JavaScript and React.
- 💬 Ask me about any of the projects on my CV, or anything at all that's relevant, really! For purposes of academic integrity, some projects' source code cannot be published publicly, but I may be able to provide private access tokens.
